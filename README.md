# DOD-Examples
I try to solve code problems

# Matrix Multiplication Optimization
matrix multiplication is  Multiply row and column but the column is a problem so we line up and cache miss chance decrease. %23 boost performance. if 4 thread run program %433 boost performance 2500 x 2500 matrics multiply on 3 sec

# OOP vs DOD 
DOD focuses on the cache line otherwise OOP focuses on Object and proportions so OOP has better change cache miss so OOP decrease performance
